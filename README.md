## DS223 Marketing Analytics - Homework on Bass Model - Davit Davtyan

### **Description of the assignment**
#### Every year, Time magazine publishes a list of the best 100 innovations of that year.
  1. Go to the list, choose an innovation.
  2. Think about look-alike innovation from the past. When you pick one, give your justifications in 1-2
  paragraphs.
  3. Go to Statista (the University provides access to it) and find a time series that approximates the
  look-alike innovation. (the University provides access to it under AUA WIFI.) or find a time series
  matching the look-alike innovation. Give your justification by 1-3 paragraphs. You can also use any
  other available resource for the data; remember to provide a reference.
  4. Estimate Bass model parameters for the look-alike innovation.
  5. Make predictions of the diffusion of the innovation you chose at stage 1
  6. Estimate the number of adopters by period. Thus, you will need to estimate the potential market
  share. You can use Fermi’s logic here as well.
  7. Do all this either worldwide or country-wise.
  Important: Whatever number you bring and use as an input, needs to have a reference. If you are using
  external research, make an academic reference as well.
